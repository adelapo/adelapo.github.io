  <p>My name is Andrew DeLapo. I recently graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in the class of 2020 with a major in mathematics and a minor in computer science.</p>
  <p>I am an aspiring mathematician. I am most interested in mathematical logic, which includes model theory, recursion theory, and set theory. I also have programming and software engineering experience.</p>
  <p>I am currently a Code Coach at theCoderSchool in Fremont.</p>
  <p>My GitHub profile is <a href="https://github.com/adelapo" target="_blank">here</a>. My email is <a href="mailto:adelapo@berkeley.edu">adelapo@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>

  <h1>Mathematical Interests and Research</h1>
  <p>I have completed graduate-level courses in model theory and recursion theory. I wrote my senior honors thesis, <i>Bernoulli Randomness and Biased Normality</i>, under the supervision of Professor Theodore Slaman. The paper is currently under review for publication, and it is available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01854" target="_blank">as a pre-print on arXiv</a>.</p>

  <p>Those who are interested in dynamical systems are encouraged to see the <a href="https://github.com/adelapo/biased-normality-ifs" target="_blank">GitHub repository for the IFS Code Visualizer</a> program I wrote as part of my senior honors thesis. My thesis ends on a few open questions regarding iterated function systems and randomness, and the IFS Code Visualizer allows for computational exploration of those questions.</p>

  <h1>Programming</h1>
  <p>I have coding experience both academically and from industry. Below is a full list of languages I have used, ordered from those with which I have the most experience to the least.</p>
